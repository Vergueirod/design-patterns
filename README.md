# ðŸ“˜ Personal Design patterns Guide

---

Design patterns originated from the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" (1994), written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, known as the Gang of Four (GoF). These patterns provide proven solutions to common software design problems, promoting reusability, flexibility, and maintainability.

They emerged to address challenges in object-oriented programming by capturing best practices from experienced developers. Design patterns are important because they help developers speak a common language, reduce complexity, and avoid reinventing the wheel.
